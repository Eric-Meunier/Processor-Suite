Differential Correction Summary:
    20 files processed.  In these files:
        23810 (100.00%) of 23810 selected positions were code corrected by post-processing
        23134 (97.16%) of 23810 selected positions were carrier corrected by post-processing
        20640 (89.22%) of code positions chosen over carrier, as they were of higher quality

    Estimated accuracies for 23810 corrected positions are as follows:
            Range	Percentage
            ----------	----------
              0-5cm	     -
             5-15cm	     -
            15-30cm	 0.00%
            30-50cm	85.12%
             0.5-1m	14.57%
               1-2m	 0.28%
               2-5m	 0.04%
